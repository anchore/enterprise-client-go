# Anchore Enterprise Go Client

This is a Go client library for the Anchore Enterprise API, providing programmatic access to container security scanning, vulnerability assessment, and policy management capabilities.

## Project Overview

The enterprise-client-go is an auto-generated Go client based on the Anchore Enterprise OpenAPI specification. It enables developers to integrate Anchore Enterprise security features into their Go applications.

## Key Features

- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Security policy evaluation and compliance checking
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and analysis
- Registry integration and image monitoring
- User and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Notification and alerting management
- Inventory tracking for Kubernetes and ECS deployments

## Architecture

The client is organized into several API modules:
- **Images API**: Container image analysis and vulnerability scanning
- **Policies API**: Security policy management and evaluation
- **Vulnerabilities API**: Vulnerability data and annotations
- **Applications API**: Application version tracking and SBOM management
- **Integrations API**: External service integrations
- **RBAC API**: User and permission management
- **System API**: System configuration and health monitoring

## Usage

This library is intended for use as a dependency in other Go projects, not as a standalone executable. It provides type-safe Go structs and methods for all Anchore Enterprise API endpoints.

## Code Generation

The client code is auto-generated from the Anchore Enterprise OpenAPI specification. To regenerate the client code, update the `ENTERPRISE_REF` in the Makefile and run `make`.

## Security Focus

All functionality is designed for defensive security purposes:
- Vulnerability detection and remediation
- Compliance monitoring and reporting  
- Secure software supply chain management
- Container security best practices enforcement
