# A Golang client for the Anchore Enterprise API

Modified from https://github.com/anchore/client-go. 
Based on generated code. No executables provided, only intended for use as a library in other projects.

To pull the swagger definition and re-generate all client go code:
```bash
make 
```

Note: the version of the enterprise where the swagger spec is pulled from is pinned in the Makefile.
