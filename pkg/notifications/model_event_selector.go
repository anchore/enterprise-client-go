// EventSelector A selector of event properties
type EventSelector struct {
	// The level of the event to filter. '*' matches events of all levels. 'info' and 'error' match related events respectively
	Level string `json:"level"`
	// The type of resource to filter. '*' matches all resource types. Some examples of resource type are 'image_digest' or 'service'
	ResourceType string `json:"resource_type"`
	// The type of event to filter, using wildcards against type field of the event. Event types have a structured format <category>.<subcategory>.<event>. Thus, '*' matches all types of events. 'system.*' matches all system events, 'user.*' matches events that are relevant to individual consumption, and omitting an asterisk will do an exact match. See the GET /event_types route definition in the engine's external API for the list of event types.
