## Methods

### NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff

`func NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff() *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff`

NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff instantiates a new ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiffWithDefaults

`func NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiffWithDefaults() *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff`

NewArtifactRelationshipSbomDiffWithDefaults instantiates a new ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetRelationship

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) GetRelationship() ArtifactRelationship`

GetRelationship returns the Relationship field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetRelationshipOk

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) GetRelationshipOk() (*ArtifactRelationship, bool)`

GetRelationshipOk returns a tuple with the Relationship field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetRelationship

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) SetRelationship(v ArtifactRelationship)`

SetRelationship sets Relationship field to given value.

### HasRelationship

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) HasRelationship() bool`

HasRelationship returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetDiff

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) GetDiff() SbomDiff`

GetDiff returns the Diff field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetDiffOk

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) GetDiffOk() (*SbomDiff, bool)`

GetDiffOk returns a tuple with the Diff field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetDiff

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) SetDiff(v SbomDiff)`

SetDiff sets Diff field to given value.

### HasDiff

`func (o *ArtifactRelationshipSbomDiff) HasDiff() bool`

HasDiff returns a boolean if a field has been set.
